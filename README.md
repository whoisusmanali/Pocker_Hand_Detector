# Pocker_Hand_Detector
In this project, I used YOLOv8 for training the model and making the object detection. Further, the dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and train the model on YOLOv8 in Google Colab. After training the best.pt file was downloaded and used for detection, in which I prepared a whole different python Functions to detect the poker hand.
