## Project Workflow
1. **Download the dataset**
2. **Modify the data.yaml file from dataset according to needs.**
3. **Apply the YOLOV8 from Ultralytics on the dataset (use Google Colab if GPU is not available)**
4. **The file name with best.pt will be created on the local machine**
5. **Download the best.pt file**
6. **Make a new Poker-Hand-Detector.py file in any offline IDE.**
7. **Upload this best.pt file and do the same coding as in Poker-Hand-Detector.py**
8. **Make a new file PokerHandFunction.py for defining the roles of the Poker Hand**
9. **Get this file in the Main file that is Poker-Hand-Detector.py**
10. **Apply the roles file and .pt file to get results.**
11. **Lastly, the results will shock you.**
